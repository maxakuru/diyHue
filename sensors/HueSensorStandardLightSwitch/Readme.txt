You can wire 2 switches with one ESP8266-01
Using a ESP8266-12 etc. is possible but you can not controll more than 2 switches
The module will register as 'Tap-Switch'.

If you only use one switch connect the not used input (GPIO2 or RX) to GND


MAKE SURE YOU DONT CONNECT ANY 230V POWERLINES TO THE SWITCH! only the 5V AC/DC-Regulator should be connected to 230V

As AC/DC-Regulator i recommend something like this:

or something like this:

Break it open, desolder the 5V USB Female connector and you have a very tiny little power converter.
