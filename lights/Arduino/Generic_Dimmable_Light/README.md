# Custom light instruction

This build is for: https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/tree/master/Lights/Arduino/Generic_Dimmable_Light

1. try out your parts and plan pathways

2. solder gnd/- pathway and the 1k OHM resistors in place

3. fasten wemos headers, and connect G pin to ground pathway

4. Bring a wires from GPIO pins to the paths with resistors

5. Fasten the blue cables (these go to the - of your strip(s)) (the board in the picture will have 2 individual controlable lights, you can have multiple strips on each)

7. Fasten 3 pin headers for mosfets

8. Connect the various paths to 3 pin headers

9. Done


This build is very simular to the Generic RGBW light build. (didnt take picture with the mosfets and wemos inserted, but i guess this can be imagined) make sure the G pin on the wemos hits the grounded path.
